## Techniques Using SOPs
# Image Carousel Using a Line

[Load Example](?remoteTox=){: .btn .btn-load-example .mr-2}

[Web](?openInBrowser=True){: .btn .btn-load-web .mr-2}

Arranging instances presents an interesting challenge, especially in the use case of image carousels or photo slide-shows. In this example we look at how we might arrange images as a gallery that stretches along a line. Here the same line that's used for the instances also describes the path for our **camera COMP**. You could similarly transform the geometry left and right to achieve the same effect.
