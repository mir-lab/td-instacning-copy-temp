## Complex rotation
# Manual Rotation Calculation - Object CHOP Version

*****

[Load Example](?remoteTox=){: .btn .btn-load-example .mr-2}
[Open Network](?openNetwork=True){: .btn .btn-td-network .mr-2}
[Web](?openInBrowser=True){: .btn .btn-load-web .mr-2}

This examples looks to achieve exactly the same outcome as the previous example, only using the **object CHOP** for a simplified workflow. Here you'll see the same results as in the previous, but in this example the rotation is calculated as a bearing measurement.
