## Using DATs For Instancing
# Data Fetched with a Script CHOP

*****

[Load Example](?remoteTox=){: .btn .btn-load-example .mr-2}
[Open Network](?openNetwork=True){: .btn .btn-td-network .mr-2}
[Web](?openInBrowser=True){: .btn .btn-load-web .mr-2}

Our final example in this series looks at the previous example at scale. At 900 instances this still performs reasonably well considering the relatively non-optimized approach. Again this condition is firmly focused on the constraint of data coming from a JSON blob.
